project:
Clean the data and perform exploratory steps that you deem appropriate. Remember that it’s important to normalize the data before you perform clustering.
Perform clustering of the data (K-means or hierarchical clustering; or if you prefer - both). How many clusters are there in the data and why?
How will your translate the clusters into business insight? In other words, what advice would you give the mall owner, so that they can design a marketing strategy using your insights.

This Clustering Analysis gives us a very clear insight about the different segments of the customers in the Mall. There are clearly Five segments of Customers namely Miser, General, Target, Spendthrift, Careful based on their Annual Income and Spending Score which are reportedly the best factors/attributes to determine the segments of a customer in a Mal
Careful : low annual income and low spending scores, this is quite reasonable as people having low salaries prefer to buy less, in fact, these are the wise people who know how to spend and save money. The shops/mall will be least interested in people belonging to this cluster.
spendthrift: low income but higher spending scores, these are those people who for some reason love to buy products more often even though they have a low income. Maybe it’s because these people are more than satisfied with the mall services. The shops/malls might not target these people that effectively but still will not lose them.
General : we see that people have average income and an average spending score, these people again will not be the prime targets of the shops or mall, but again they will be considered and other data analysis techniques may be used to increase their spending score.
Miser : we see that people have high income but low spending scores, this is interesting. Maybe these are the people who are unsatisfied or unhappy by the mall’s services. These can be the prime targets of the mall, as they have the potential to spend money. So, the mall authorities will try to add new facilities so that they can attract these people and can meet their needs.
Target : we see that people have high income and high spending scores, this is the ideal case for the mall or shops as these people are the prime sources of profit. These people might be the regular customers of the mall and are convinced by the mall’s facilities
According to my own intuition by looking at the above clustering plot between the age of the customers and their corresponding spending scores, I have aggregated them into 4 different categories namely Usual Customers, Priority Customers, Senior Citizen Target Customers, Young Target Customers. 
Then after getting the results we can accordingly make different marketing strategies and policies to optimize the spending scores of the customer in the Mall.
